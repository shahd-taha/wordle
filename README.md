Folder structure:-

main.py file: includes the main code of the wordle game (the functions and the main loop).

dataset.txt file: includes set of all 5-letter words in the dictionary, the program picks a random target word from here.

README.md file: text file includes folder layout, how the game works and explains the code logic.


Logical structure:-

Functions:
random_word: for the program to choose a random word from the dataset file and make it the target to be guessed.

enter_word: for input handling takes guessed word from user letter by letter.

check_guess: checks whether the guess provided by user is in the dataset or not.

feedback: compares each letter of the guess to the target and says if itâ€™s in the correct place, in the wrong place, or not in the word at all.


Main game code: 
consists of a loop with 6 iterations to give the user 6 chances of guessing the word, the output of each iteration in the main loop will be one of the following:
1-when the guess is wrong but in the dataset: 'Incorrect guess' along with feedback
2-when the guess isn't in the dataset: 'That word isn't in the dictionary'
3-when the guess is correct:'Congratulations you've guessed the word correctly'

The game ends when the user correctly guesses the words or when the 6 loop iterations are done without reaching the correct guess <game over>
